# [Unitex-Bot Calista](https://github.com/gsi-upm/calista-bot/Agent-system)


Grammar and corpus files for Calista-Bot project. Includes the [Unitex](http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~unitex/) 2.1 libraries and the [UnitexJNI](https://github.com/ergonotics/JNI-for-Unitex-2.1) libraries.
The grammar engine is used for detecting specific patterns by applying grammars to the user query. These grammars are usually applied to match phrases containing a set of concepts specified in a list (for example, 'do-while', a concept of the Java programming language). This list of concepts can also be updated dynamically during the conversation. 



##Installation of [Unitex](http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~unitex/)

[Unitex](http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~unitex/) 2.1 has been used for the Grammar engine module of our project. It can be downloaded from the [Unitex download](http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~unitex/index.php?page=3) site.
