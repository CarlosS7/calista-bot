# [SOLR Calista](https://github.com/gsi-upm/calista-bot/solr-elearning)

Linked Open Data Server module for Calista-Bot project. It makes use of the 4.10.2
 version of [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/). This module contains 
 a connector between the Solr Server and the maia service, which has previously 
 been populated with the scrapped data (provided, as well as a solrconfig.xml, and a
 schema.xml for the solr in the src/main/resources and src/main/resources/solr folders).
   
 For example, in the personal assistance system for a e-learning platform, when
 the user sends a question and no information is found in the KB, this server
 is ready to provide the needed information. 



###  Launching the module

Assuming the solr server is already configured, edit the config file to provide with the server URL and the core,
and build the project:

```bash
:~/calista-bot/solr-elearning/$ mvn package
```

And just launch it:

 ```bash
:~/calista-bot/solr-elearning$ java -jar target/solr-elearning-jar-with-dependencies.jar -c solr-elearning.properties
```
