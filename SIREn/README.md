# [SIREn-Bot Calista](https://github.com/gsi-upm/calista-bot/SIREn)


Linked Open Data Server module for Calista-Bot project. It makes use of the 1.0 commercial version of [SIREn](http://siren.sindice.com/). This module contains indexed information, which has been previously added by the system administrator. For example, in the personal assistance system for a e-learning platform, when the user sends a question and no information is found in the KB, this server is ready to provide the needed information. 



###Launching the Linked Open Data Server module


The Linked Open Data Server module makes use of the 1.0 commercial version of [SIREn](http://siren.sindice.com/). This commercial version can be requested to [Sindice](http://www.sindice.com/). Also, a development version of SIREn can be found in the [SIREn repository](https://github.com/rdelbru/SIREn/). 


The first using SIREn, we need to compile the source code. We can do it by running (needs [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) installed):

	mvn clean package assembly:single 


Once the project is compiled, we should be able run any of its sample classes:

	java -cp ./target/siren-jar-with-dependencies.jar org.sindice.siren.demo.bnb.BNBDemo
