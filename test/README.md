# [test-Bot Calista](https://github.com/gsi-upm/calista-bot/test)


[ChatScript](http://sourceforge.net/projects/chatscript/) test corpus for the system evaluation. With it, we make an evaluation of the system implemented in our project. We will use this evaluation to show the benefits from including a Grammar Engine, a Linked Open Data Server and an Agent system. We will remark all the features obtained from them and the possibilities that they offer, opposite to only using only ChatScript or other Chatbot technology alone.



###Execution


These corpus files should be copied to the /ChatScript/RAWDATA/ folder. They can be compiled and loaded by running [ChatScript](http://sourceforge.net/projects/chatscript/) locally:
To launch ChatScript locally on Windows, the following command should be run inside the ChatScript folder:
	chatscript local


On Linux, the following command should be run inside the ChatScript folder:
	./LinuxChatScript32 local

Once ChatScript is locally launched, we can use the following command to build and load the corpus:
	:build 1
